# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- **Local LAN protocol implementation** (`jebao_gizwits/`) of the Gizwits
  "GAgent" WiFi protocol Jebao pumps actually speak: UDP discovery, TCP
  status reads, and writes — including the bit-packed boolean/enum write
  encoding, reverse-engineered from the vendor app's own debug logging.
  See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) and [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for how.
- **Home Assistant integration** (`custom_components/jebao_local/`),
  schema-driven so it isn't hardcoded to one product: config flow with LAN
  discovery or manual IP entry, `DataUpdateCoordinator`-based polling, and
  switch/select/number/binary_sensor entities generated from each device's
  datapoint schema.
- **29 bundled WiFi-capable product schemas** (wavemakers, dosing pumps,
  lights, filters, other pumps) extracted from the vendor app — see
  [docs/SUPPORTED_MODELS.md](docs/SUPPORTED_MODELS.md).
- Verified live against real hardware: discovery, status reads, numeric
  writes, and the `SwitchON` boolean write. Verified to coexist cleanly
  alongside another real HA integration (no domain/dependency conflicts).

### Known gaps

- The integration itself hasn't been exercised inside a running Home
  Assistant instance (config flow → entity creation → live update cycle) —
  only import/static checks have run so far.
- Bit-type writes other than `SwitchON` use the same confirmed encoding
  formula but haven't been individually tested against live hardware.
- Schedule programming (48 daily timer slots) is decodable but not yet
  exposed as an HA entity.
