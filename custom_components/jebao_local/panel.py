"""Serve the bundled Control panel and the native Lovelace card, and add the
panel to the sidebar.

Both ship inside the integration (``panel/designer.html``,
``lovelace/jebao-pump-card.js``) so that a HACS install delivers them too -
HACS only copies ``custom_components/``, so a file left in ``config/www``
would never arrive (that was the original design, fixed here - see
CHANGELOG.md). Registering them here means the card resolves with no manual
"Settings > Dashboards > Resources" step, and the panel is available at
``/jebao_local/designer.html`` with no manual file copying and no
``configuration.yaml`` edits.
